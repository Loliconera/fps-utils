# Gui

Allows you to have access to the welcome message window where you can click stuffs.

## For Developers:

You just require it like normal or just read the source it's like 5 lines if you wanna use it.
Example :
```
const Gui = require('Gui')

module.exports = function (mod) {
	const gui = new Gui(mod)
	mod.command.add('guitest', () => {
		gui.parse(
			[
				{
					text: `Test text!`,                 //Text goes here.
					command: `fps mode 3`,              //Command which will get send by 'command.exec()'.
					img: `icon_items.homonculus1_tex`   //Image 'category.name' will appear infront of text.
				}
			],
			'This is a test!'							//Title goes here.
		)
	})
	this.destructor = () => {
		mod.command.remove('guitest')					//This just for reloading.
	}
}
```
## Additional things to know
- Multiple commands can now be split/chained together by using `command: "cmd1;cmd2"`
